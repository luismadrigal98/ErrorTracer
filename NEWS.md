# ErrorTracer (development)

## Breaking changes / deprecations

* `shelf_life()`: the `plausible_range` argument is deprecated. Use
  `response_scale` instead. `plausible_range` still works but emits a
  warning. It will be removed in a future release.

## New features

* `shelf_life()` now includes `se_t_star` in the projected-mode horizon
  attribute. This is the delta-method standard error of the projected
  crossing time `t* = (τ − a) / b`, propagating the linear-fit covariance.

* `decompose_uncertainty()` and the underlying `.decompose_from_arrays()`
  helper now support non-Gaussian families (Binomial, Poisson, Student-t,
  Negative-Binomial, Beta, Gamma) by computing all variance components on
  the response scale via the inverse link. For Gaussian identity the result
  is numerically unchanged.

* `et_predict()` gains an `n_env_draws` argument. Setting it > 1 averages
  multiple independent perturbations per posterior draw, reducing Monte
  Carlo noise in the environmental variance estimate. The decomposition
  data frame gains a `v_env_mcse` column reporting the chi-squared standard
  error of `env_var`.

# ErrorTracer 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN submission.

* Initial CRAN release.
* Added full Bayesian error propagation pipeline using `brms`.
* Added three-way variance decomposition and forecast shelf life metrics.
